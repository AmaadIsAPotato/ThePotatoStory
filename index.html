        <h1>The Potato Story</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Once, I ate a potato. It was the most delicious potato that I have ever eaten in my life. It was the most scrumptious, delicious, carbohydrate that e’er I thought would exist. It truly brought out the most excitement from Fred Bareggi, and it caught the eyes of any living being who walked by. Surely, it had been the best product of all time. Even Alexey Kosovan was as excited as I was. At one point, I was so interested in the sheer flavour of the lone carbohydrate that I was about to explode in a burst of overjoy. The most succulent of all, the king, hail, hail the potato. I took another bite. It was better than the last, the juices of the carbohydrate flooding my gums and taste buds with a delectable mountain of pure tastefulness. I took another bite, and another, and another. Each bite was better than the last. I kept a small chink for safekeeping. I seldom stopped eating for the fact of keeping the succulent king. I had to force my taste buds to keep the taste within them, I was struggling to stop. It was addictive, like a video game. The potato was better than Mario, or whatever you want to address it by. I was starstruck. I couldn’t stop, it was like a drug. I kept the taste in my mouth until it was no longer a possible outcome. I then bagged the potato with a state-of-the-art vacuum sealer and pocketed it in a small briefcase that I manufactured within that minute, just for this potato. I carried the briefcase outside of my pocket after deciding to ditch the idea of pocketing it. I had to keep this potato for my whole life. It couldn’t be lost. This potato, I thought, was one of the most beautiful, delicious, scrumptious, whatever words you can use to describe the sheer excellence of this singular carbohydrate that I had just partly consumed. 
            Aside from the most delectable potato, there was another. A one, almost equal in delectability. One that, some may describe as the most delicious potassium containing treat for one human being. This “Potassium Proprietor” in question, would happen to be one named by, not its colour, but it’s essence. That essence is that of a Banana. A banana that rivaled the taste of the carbohydrate that we had just previously encountered. I found it at a stall owned by not a group of people, not by a couple of people, but by one singular, elderly lady who was sat behind that stall with a corroded steel walking stick. I almost empathized this lady, for the happiness yet depression that sat on her wrinkled face. I approached the stall with the intention of browsing the inventory of this elderly human being. If I were to recall that old lady’s name, she was a one “Deon Minkah”. She was elder both in the physical and the mental. She had a bit of a stutter here and there, and also seemed to smell strongly of perfume, one called “L'odeur des toilettes”. It was an exquisite smelling perfume that tickled the nostrils of thine nasal passageway. Since she smelled so strongly of the substance, the fruits she sold, consequently, also smelled of this odor. It seemed to give the consumables a more desirable appearance. The first I saw was a yellow, crescent shaped fruity object known as a Banana. I held it in my hand, and thereafter took one singular, small, miniscule nibble of the Banana. It was, how do I put it, immeasurable other than by the potato. This banana was perhaps the most delicious potassium holding object that ever I had tasted. It had the taste of that one anti-biotic you get as a kid. It was beautiful. It may well have been just as good as the carbohydrate, and maybe even more depending on your taste buds. It surely was a pleasurable experience, eating that banana, however, there was yet another. One whose orange appearance was the most appealing-in-terms-of-appearance object that I had seen, yet it didn’t have the sheer excellence of the previous Potassium and Carbohydrate foodstuffs.
            The orange was an edible spherical shaped object known as an orange. This orange was sold by a man known as Alex Hardy, in the stall very much opposite of Deon Minkah’s. This orange was one that has the looks of the perfect, juicy, appealing shade of orange, Montana Dust. It was a redish orange, one that really caught the eyes of myself in particular. Everyone else seemed to be distracted by other people advertising their stalls, handing out brochures, and using any other means of words and signs to give themselves the publicity that they needed. I was particularly drawn toward this stall specifically because of the lack of popularity, that mysterious feeling crawling inside of me, telling me to approach this man known as Alex Hardy. As I slowly advanced toward the lonely wooden stall, I thought of all the bad consequences that this could have. A kidnapping, getting scammed, as well as many more very unrealistic scenarios, which I put to one side. Not forgetting remembering them, but just leaving them there as a mental note for me to hold on to if needed in case of emergency. I continued approaching the stall at a steady pace. I crept ever closer as reality struck. This man was just an elderly grandpa who was probably in crippling pain mentally and physically. I locked eyes with the target. The Montana Dust Orange. I sped up, walking faster, growing ever closer before the object. I had already changed my hand position to best fit the grip of the orange, but something stopped me from immediately grabbing it. I asked the man’s name, and he replied, of course, with Alex Hardy, which was printed on the banner of his stall. I remember ever so slightly the scent of the orange that I picked up. I saw it. I smelt it before I even held it in my very own hands. I decided that, if I do leave this orange here, I must find where it was sourced, even if it didn’t taste as good as it looked. This orange had the perfect shade of the colour wrapped all around the circumference of it. It may have been dang near well perfect. I decided to buy the orange for roughly 50 pence, a bargain in my opinion. After buying it I decided to keep it for safekeeping with the potato and the banana. After I had collected these three different consumables. I took a walk back to my car, which was stationed outside the market on a side street called Middle St., since it was located pretty much dead center in the city.
            I hopped into my 1971 Olds’ 442 W-30, and booted up the engine, which roared to life after three cranks of the key. I loved this car. It was my pure joy, and the best part – it was powered by an engine that I had been manufacturing over the past ten years – the potato engine. It was fully functionable and produced a whopping 236 horsepower when tuned properly. The potatoes needed to be changed out once every few months, but it was an inexpensive maintenance cost. Maybe one of the only things that I could properly afford, at ~£10 per potato change. I found this to be a very useful alternate way of driving that also used no fuel and was very economically supportive. And, the car was very enjoyable to drive because of the things mentioned. I often found myself driving subconsciously and not realizing where I was going. 
        But alas, today was different. I had to drive to the lab, which was the place where I conducted all my experiments and was also the place where I stored all of the important things that I could not keep at my own house, even though I ended up sleeping in the lab the whole time. I took a sharp left out of Middle St. and into the main road, where there was cars parked on either side of the road, filling up both lengths, as well as a steady horde of traffic going toward the market. Lucky for me, I had arrived rather early and so the mainstream shoppers were yet to arrive – or rather, they were currently arriving at the market. I decided that I would leave the area before it became too hard for me to leave at all. I kept the edibles in my padded suitcase and headed towards the lab, which was only a couple of minutes away by drive. Sometimes I like to just walk along the main roads towards the lab, but I could only do that on days where it wasn’t -5 degrees Celsius, as it was right now. And so therefore, I took my car down the usual route, left, right, right, left, right, 3rd exit at the roundabout. 
        As I pulled into the parking lot, I started to think about how I could source out these specific objects. But, I put that aside as I entered the lab, where I was greeted by the receptionist, a kind lady by the name of Max Chin-You. She was really short, but nobody ever told her that, since we wanted her to stay happy, like she always was. I quickly greeted her before leaving to get to my laboratory, which was located on the third floor, in room 405. I swiftly slid inside and greeted my HouseBot, and artificial intelligence that had the ability to do chores and maintenance in the lab while I was gone. My HouseBot was named Bob. I named him Bob, purely just because it was the first thing that came to my mind when I was naming him. I liked Bob, he was cool, and – added bonus – he had adapted to my likes and dislikes so he always agreed with me, which I loved. Anyway, I needed to put the stuff somewhere, and that somewhere was a place that I had made years before, in preparation of this very moment. A special room in my lab dedicated to when I had found stuff worthy of the spot on the podium – shoot, I gave it away. But anyway, I made a podium to put the edibles on years in advance, for this very moment. I placed each thing on its own podium spot and was pleased to see that they all fit really well together.</p>
